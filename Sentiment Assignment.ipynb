    "Cher's \"Sisters of Mercy\" expresses negativity towards religious institutions and individuals who use religion to justify harm, especially towards women and children. The song calls out the lack of mercy, grace, and faith among these people. On the other hand, \"All I Really Want To Do\" is a happy song about wanting to form a genuine friendship without any ulterior motives or competition.\"Our Lady of San Francisco\" addresses the problem of homelessness and the lack of support for those in need. The lyrics show frustration with society's current state and a longing for change to help those struggling.\n",

    "The first song emphasizes the importance of treating your partner with love, respect, and attention. It warns that without these things, you'll receive only hatred in return. The second song, \"Baby Forgive Me,\" asks for forgiveness and another chance in a relationship. The third song, \"Who's That Girl,\" challenges the traditional expectations of what it means to be a \"good girl\" and asks who the ideal girl is that men dream of.\n",

    "Robyn's first song, \"Lose Control,\" expresses frustration and discomfort when we can't control a situation or our emotions. The song's chorus repeats the line, \"You don't like what you can't control,\" highlighting the negativity that arises from a lack of control. In contrast, Robyn's second song, \"Still Your Girl,\" conveys loyalty and support towards a friend or partner. The singer promises to remain a steadfast companion through hardships and difficulties. The chorus repeats the line, \"I'm still your girl,\" emphasizing the message of support and loyalty.Finally, Robyn's \"Criminal Intent\" challenges societal norms regarding sexuality. The lyrics suggest that engaging in sexual acts is not a crime, but rather a natural and enjoyable part of life. The chorus playfully repeats the phrase, \"Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent,\" conveying the song's rebellious tone.\n",
